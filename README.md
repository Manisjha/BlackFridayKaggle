# 🛍️ Black Friday Dataset – EDA & Feature Engineering

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project performs a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering on the Black Friday dataset, which contains customer purchase behavior during a major retail event. The goal is to clean, transform, and analyze the data to uncover insights about consumer demographics, spending patterns, and product preferences.

Inspired by Krish Naik’s Day 2 live session, this project demonstrates practical data preprocessing techniques and prepares the dataset for predictive modeling and business analytics.

## 📂 Dataset Description  
The dataset includes:
- Customer ID, age, gender, occupation
- City category and years of residence
- Product categories
- Purchase amount

It’s ideal for understanding consumer behavior and building models for customer segmentation or purchase prediction.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Engineer new features from existing data  
- Visualize trends and relationships  
- Prepare data for machine learning workflows

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Imputing missing values  
   - Removing duplicates  
   - Detecting and handling outliers

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Encoding gender, city category, and product categories  
   - Creating age brackets and tenure features  
   - Transforming skewed purchase data

3. **Visualization**  
   - Purchase trends by age, gender, and city  
   - Distribution of purchase amounts  
   - Correlation heatmaps

---

## 📈 Insights  
- Younger age groups and urban cities show higher purchase volumes  
- Gender and occupation influence spending behavior  
- Feature engineering improves data quality for modeling
